# Flipkart System Design

## Overview
Flipkart is a large-scale e-commerce platform that enables users to browse, search, and purchase products online. This system design focuses on creating a scalable, highly available, and fault-tolerant architecture for Flipkart-like services.

## Architecture
The system follows a **microservices-based** architecture with **event-driven communication** to ensure scalability and reliability.

### High-Level Architecture Components:
1. **User Service** - Handles user authentication, profiles, and preferences.
2. **Product Catalog Service** - Stores and retrieves product details.
3. **Search Service** - Implements indexing and search functionality.
4. **Order Management Service** - Manages cart, order placement, and tracking.
5. **Payment Service** - Processes transactions securely.
6. **Inventory Service** - Manages stock levels and warehouse synchronization.
7. **Recommendation Engine** - Uses machine learning to provide personalized suggestions.
8. **Notification Service** - Sends order updates via email, SMS, and push notifications.
9. **Review & Rating Service** - Stores customer feedback and ratings.
10. **Analytics & Logging Service** - Collects and analyzes user behavior for business insights.

## Database Design

### **User Table** (SQL - Relational DB)
| Field      | Type          | Description               |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------------|
| user_id   | INT (Primary Key) | Unique user identifier |
| name      | VARCHAR      | User's full name         |
| email     | VARCHAR      | Email address            |
| password  | VARCHAR      | Hashed password          |
| address   | TEXT         | Shipping address         |
| phone     | VARCHAR      | Contact number           |

### **Product Table** (NoSQL - MongoDB)
```json
{
  "product_id": "P1234",
  "name": "Laptop XYZ",
  "category": "Electronics",
  "price": 45000,
  "stock": 100,
  "seller_id": "S001",
  "ratings": 4.5
}
```

### **Order Table** (SQL - MySQL)
| Field      | Type          | Description               |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------------|
| order_id  | INT (Primary Key) | Unique order identifier |
| user_id   | INT (Foreign Key) | Reference to user      |
| product_id | VARCHAR  | Ordered product ID      |
| quantity  | INT         | Number of items ordered |
| status    | VARCHAR      | Order status (Pending, Shipped, Delivered) |
| timestamp | DATETIME     | Order placement time     |

## Scaling Strategies
- **Load Balancing**: Use **Nginx** or **AWS ALB** to distribute traffic across multiple servers.
- **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**: Use **Cloudflare** or **AWS CloudFront** to cache product images and static content.
- **Database Sharding**: Partition user and order data across multiple database instances.
- **Caching Layer**: Use **Redis** or **Memcached** to cache frequently accessed data.
- **Message Queue**: Use **Kafka** or **RabbitMQ** for asynchronous communication between services.
- **Auto-Scaling**: Deploy on **AWS EC2** or **Kubernetes** for horizontal scaling.

## Technologies Used
| Component        | Technology Used |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Backend         | Node.js, Spring Boot |
| Frontend        | React.js, Next.js  |
| Database (SQL)  | MySQL, PostgreSQL  |
| Database (NoSQL)| MongoDB, Redis    |
| Message Queue   | Kafka, RabbitMQ   |
| Load Balancing  | Nginx, AWS ALB    |
| Storage         | AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage |
| Payment Gateway | Razorpay, PayPal  |
| Search Engine   | Elasticsearch, Solr  |
| Logging & Monitoring | Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack |

## API Endpoints

- `POST /products` â†’ Add a new product

### 3. **Order Service**
- `POST /orders` â†’ Place an order
- `GET /orders/{id}` â†’ Get order details
- `PATCH /orders/{id}` â†’ Update order status

### 4. **Search Service**
